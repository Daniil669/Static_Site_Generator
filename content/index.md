## Reasons I love retro games

- Theyâ€™re simple, challenging, and addictive  
- The music stays in your head forever  
- You can master them, but never _truly_ win  
- They started everything modern gaming became

1. Donkey Kong
2. Pac-Man
3. Space Invaders
4. Tetris
5. Galaga
6. Pong
7. Frogger
8. Contra
9. Metroid

    start_game();
    score++;
}
```
